## Studies and the beginnings of programming

I graduated from the Poznań University of Technology with the title of an engineer in management, during the classes I learned programming and learned such languages as HTML, CSS and SQL. However, it was only when I started to be privately interested in web technologies that learning became pleasant and absorbing for me. I was delighted with the amount of tools and options that can be used to awaken your creativity.

I graduated from the Kodilla programming school, thanks to which I learned more about technologies and, above all, the methodology of a professional programmer's work.

### Passion and plans for the future

On a daily basis I am a huge fan of practicing sports, I especially enjoy playing team sports such as basketball, soccer and American football.
In the future, I would like to combine these two worlds: programming and sports, to create applications useful for clubs, coaches and players.

# I want to cooperate!

I am a novice programmer with no commercial experience, so I am open to any kind of cooperation. I can easily take up a **free internship**. I can assure you that I am ambitious and I do not give up easily when it comes to solving a complicated problem.
