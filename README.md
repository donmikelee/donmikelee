# Hello there! :wave::wave::wave:

My name is MichaÅ‚ GÃ³rny, I have been learning web programming for a year to become a Front End developer.

## Studies and the beginnings of programming :mortar_board::computer:

I graduated from the PoznaÅ„ University of Technology with the title of an engineer in management, during the classes I learned programming and learned such languages as HTML, CSS and SQL. However, it was only when I started to be privately interested in web technologies that learning became pleasant and absorbing for me. I was delighted with the amount of tools and options that can be used to awaken your creativity.

I graduated from the Kodilla programming school, thanks to which I learned more about technologies and, above all, the methodology of a professional programmer's work.

I work as a Frontend Developer at DomData, a company specializing in low-code solutions for the banking sector. My role involves developing and maintaining custom UI components, creating and supporting design themes, and ensuring visual consistency across various products.
I collaborate closely with the UI/UX team to turn designs into functional interfaces. I also actively participate in client meetings, where we discuss application behavior, usability, and alignment with design objectives.
With a focus on frontend problem-solving, I contribute to both the look and functionality of the software, enhancing user experience and application performance.

### Passion and plans for the future :basketball::soccer::football:

On a daily basis I am a huge fan of practicing sports, I especially enjoy playing team sports such as basketball, soccer and American football.
In the future, I would like to combine these two worlds: programming and sports, to create applications useful for clubs, coaches and players.
